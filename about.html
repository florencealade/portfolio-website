<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>

<p>I’m Florence, a designer with a passion for creating new things and seeing my ideas become a reality. The box is something that I like to think does not exist and that ideas are limitless (even though that can mean some crazy notions). I constantly have a wastebin full of paper but it comes with the territory. I like to learn as I go from anything and everything. I consider myself to be an explorer of both the world and of my mind.

  <br><br>
I’m currently studying Interaction Design at Ulster University to better improve my skills and learn new ones. This has meant that I now feel more confident in my abilities and what I can do. I love to try new things and to have new experiences. I’m excited to see what the future holds for me and where design will take me.</p>
